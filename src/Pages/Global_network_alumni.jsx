          IIT Roorkee is pleased to launch a Global Network of IIT Roorkee
          Alumni to establish an extensive connect with its large number of
          alumni spread all over the world. It will fulfill a longstanding need
          of the institute and its alumni for a comprehensive and accurate
          alumni database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, many alumni have been asking for a network that can help them
          search and connect with fellow alumni and also facilitate interfacing
          with the institute through a single window. The Global Network will
          seek to address this need also.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Network will contribute in keeping alive the heritage and legacy
          of Thomason College of Civil Engineering to University of Roorkee and
          now IIT Roorkee. It would blend the old and new generations of alumni
          of this unique institute with a glorious history since 1847.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Global Network of IIT Roorkee Alumni will be run by alumni
          volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provisions will be built in the implementation of the network so as to
          ensure that privacy concerns of the members are fully taken care of.
          Further, the members will have the flexibility to subscribe and
          unsubscribe messages and services as per their wish. Special care will
          be taken to ensure security of the database.
        </p>
        <p>

          On this occasion, Prof Ajit Chaturvedi Director IIT Roorkee said, "In
          this digital age, there is a paradigm shift in relation to social and
          professional networking. Information technology has raised
          expectations of alumni and students for a flat and efficient platform
          instead of a hierarchical and bureaucratic process. They want to
          connect seamlessly with each other and with the institute too." He
          further added, "This will probably be the first network of its kind in
          the country. We believe it has the potential to be replicated in other
          academic institutions."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hon’ble President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind, in his
          Convocation address at IIT Roorkee on 4th October 2019, had also
          expressed the need for simpler ways to connect with the alumni.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Mohinder L. Nayyar, a US-based alumnus of 1966 batch of IITR, who
          is a Fellow of American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),
          Distinguished Alumnus Awardee and one of the top donors of IIT
          Roorkee, said, "The Global Network of IIT Roorkee Alumni is a
          pioneering initiative. It would serve the need of our times and
          future. The present and future alumni will find it effective in
          establishing, strengthening, and enjoying continued bond with their
          alma mater. The potential benefits to members of this network add an
          attractive and fulfilling dimension."
        </p>
        <p>
          He further added, "I expect the concept of this network to be adopted
          by other world class educational institutions not only in India, but
          in rest of the world also. I feel honored to be an alum of IIT
          Roorkee, which enjoys envious status for the unmatched and
          constructive contributions made by its alumni in India and around the
          globe."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. B. K. Chaturvedi, alumnus of 1969 batch of IIT Roorkee, former
          Managing Director of Eicher Ltd, Ex-President of Hindustan Motors and
          a Distinguished Alumnus Awardee of the Institute, stated that setting
          up of this Global Network of IITR Alumni will take Alumni-Institute
          connect to newer heights. It will greatly facilitate alumni to alumni
          connect all across the globe. This platform, which would keep getting
          refined with users experience, is likely to emerge as a trend setter
          in alumni-alma mater connect for other educational institutions in the
          country.
